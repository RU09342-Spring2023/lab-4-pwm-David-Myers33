##Report on Part 1
This code is designed to effect the brightness of the two LEDs on the MSP430 board. We start with a defined variable, DutyCycle being set to 501. This will be useful later for our timer, as this value will allow it to overflow correctly, thus effecting the brightness of the LED. Next, we establed 4 void functions. LEDsetup, ButtonSetup, TimerA0Setup, and TimerA1Setup. The first two are simply initialzation of the LEDs and buttons, with the exception that the buttons are configured as pull-up, low to high edge, and have interrupts enabled. Both Timer functions share the same code. They both use SMCLK in up mode, followed by enabling interrupts for each respective timer, then setting CCR0 to 1000, finally setting TBxCCR1 to Duty Cycle. Much of this timer setup is based on the softwarePWM example provided in class. This brings us to the interrupts for buttons P2.3 and P4.1. Here, each button checks if TBxCCR1 is >=999 if this is true, then TBxCCR1 is set to 1. If this isn't true, TBxCCR1 gets 100 added to it. Both buttons run the same code. Essentially, if TBxCCR1 >999 it gets reset to 1, this then triggers the led to dim. The final parts of the code are also from the PWMexample code provided.
