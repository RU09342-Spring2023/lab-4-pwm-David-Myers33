#Report part 2

This code cycles through colors of an RGB LED. It starts with two void functions, TimerA3Setup and LEDSetup, followed by setting global variables count, and color as integers, and set them equal to zero. Next in our void function, we set the watchdog timer to a speed of 1000ms. TimerA3Setup initializes the timer. TB3CCTL0 is configured to allow for Overflow IRQ. TB3CCR0 is set to 0xFFFF which is our PWM period. TB3CCTL1 is set to outmode_7 which will set/reset. TBCCR1 is set to 800 which acts as the duty cycle. Finally, TB3CTL is set as SMCLK in up-mode. Next, the LEDs are initialized in the LEDSetup function. In here, we have it configured so that red is always the first color initialized. After this, we have an interrupt that checks the status of the previous color to determine if the next color should be shown. Everytime the interrupt triggers, count gets 1 added to it. for example, when it starts, count gets 1 added to it and color stays 0. an if statement within the interrupt checks if this condition is met, if it is, color gets changed to one, and count gets reset to 0, and the next color is shown and the revious one turns off. After this point, count is no longer used and the if statements are based purely on what the integer color equals. This cycle will endlessly loop until the program is terminated.
